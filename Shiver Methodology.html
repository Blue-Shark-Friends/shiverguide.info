        <h3>
            1. Name your community
        </h3>
            <p2>
                Make your shiver visible to each other. It's not a community
                if people do not know who each other are.
            </p2>
        <h3>
            2. Identify your needs
        </h3>
            <p3>
                Your first measure of success is can you take care of your
                own. Make your shiver's needs public. Be vulnerable. Ask
                for help.
            </p3>
        <h3>
            3. Connect your Community

            4. Fail in public
        </h3>
            <p5>
                Do the simplest version of your community projects for
                others in public as early as possible. Take in feedback.
                Iterate.
