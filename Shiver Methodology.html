            The shiver methodology is a daughter of the agile methodology.  
            It is a tech methodology for organizing community.  
            It is replicable team-building methodology that can be grafted onto any industry.
            Below are the steps to forming a Shiver Community

        </h3>
            <p2>
                Make your shiver visible to each other. It's not a community
                if people do not know who each other are.

        </h3>
            <p3>
                Your first measure of success is can you take care of your
                own. Make your shiver's needs public. Be vulnerable. Ask
                for help.
            </p3>

                community are met.
